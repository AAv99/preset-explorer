Animation curve rules:
- For most cases use an "ease-out" animation curve as it will make the interface feel fast and natural.
- When animating things that are already visible, "ease-in-out" is a good choice as it will start and end slowly, but speed up in the middle.
- Never use "linear" curves, expect for very specific cases like an infinite loop marquee where you need a constant speed.`,
